# covid_model_workshop
Code to support R workshop on modelling SARS-CoV-2 transmission using the package nimue.


Today we will be looking how modelling has been used to support decisions around the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, using a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This model was developed at Imperial College London and is downloadable and open-source as a package in R.

Documentation for the package is available here:
[https://mrc-ide.github.io/nimue/](https://mrc-ide.github.io/nimue/)

Code on which this workshop is based:
